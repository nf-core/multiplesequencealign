## Introduction

**nf-core/msa** is a bioinformatics pipeline to run and systematically evaluate Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) methods.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/proteinfold/results).

1. **Stats**: computation of summary statistics on the input fasta file, such as the average similarity across sequences, their length, etc.
2. **Collect dress-up infos**: any external information required by the downstream steps will be retrieved. For example, in the case of protein sequences, subworkflows of the proteinfold pipeline can be used to run de novo protein structure prediction software, alternatively, a database search followed by the fetching of the structures.
3. **Align**: runs multiple sequence alignment software. If possible, distance metrics computation, guide tree rendering and assembly steps will be kept separate to evaluate their individual contribution to the final result.
4. **Evaluate**: here the MSAs are evaluated with different metrics: Sum Of Pairs (SoP), Total Column score (TC), iRMSD, Total Consistency Score (TCS), etc.
5. **Visualize**: colour the MSA according to TCS, visualize summary plots about performance etc.
6. **Compress**: as the final MSA files are very large, compression tools will be used before storing the final result

## Usage

> **Note**
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
> to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
> with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/msa \
   -profile test \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --tools toolsheet.csv \
   --outdir outdir
```

> **Warning:**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
> provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/msa/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/msa/parameters).
